I am an associate professor at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.umbmath.sk/) of the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia. 

I am also affiliated with [NHH - Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/lukas-laffers/) (associate professor II), where I defended my PhD thesis in Economics in 2014. I was appointed to [associate professor of Economics](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/518234-lukas-laffers/qualifications) (docent) by [Masaryk University in Brno](https://www.econ.muni.cz/en) in 2024. 

My research interests lie mainly within the areas of econometrics, causal inference, partial identification, and labor economics.
